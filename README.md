# TISE
Mini project: Solving the Time Independent Schrodinger Equation (TISE) in 1D

This project is an attempt to numerically solve the 1D TISE for a particle in a potential well using Python. 

It includes code that:
- Implements both the **finite difference** and **shooting** methods
- Computes and visualizes **eigenfunctions** and **eigenenergies**
- Plots **wavefunctions** and **energy levels**

Physics:
**Schrödinger Equation:**
- Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation in 1D:
      −ℏ²⁄2m · d²ψ/dx² + V(x)ψ = Eψ
  
      *In atomic units (ℏ = m = 1):*
  
  so
  
      -1/2 · d²ψ/dx² + V(x)ψ = Eψ

Disclaimer:
This project was created as a personal learning exercise based on university coursework and independent study. It is intended as a portfolio piece and a practice tool for numerical physics.
